# Iemcrpautobot_test
Hey all, we created an script in which we automated the online daily attendance exam of our college.
So to use this, just enter your username, password and iemcrp exam code in the cell and just run it. Just make sure you have the neccessary modules and also you need one file (https://www.kaggle.com/syedamer/gnewsvector) and save it in any path and access that path in the code and you are done!!
